Title: COVID19 Spread Simulation using Python



Updates on 3.31

It has almost been a month since the quarantine started here in New York. Things have changed dramatically since I started this blog in early Feb. I started this blog because I was frustrated at not being able to easily find a single number that could tell me the total number of cases. Now google seems to have fixed that and there are more websites presenting decent nicely looking tables that are easy to scrape. 

Attached is my code, if you would like to try. The output format is json.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from ast import literal_eval
import requests
import re, json
import pandas as pd


def get_text_bs(tree):
	""" extract data array from the charts 
		input: html
		output: dict
	"""
	body = tree.body
	if body is None:
		return None
	v = {}
	process_array = lambda sector : literal_eval(sector.split(':')[1].replace(' ',''))
	for tag in body.select('script'):
		if 'Highcharts.chart' in str(tag):
			tag = str(tag).replace('\n','').split('       ')
			for sector in tag:
				if 'categories' in sector and 'date' not in v.keys():
					v['date'] = process_array(sector)
				if 'text' in sector:
					title = sector
				if 'data' in sector:
					if 'Total Coronavirus Cases' in title:
						v['total'] = process_array(sector)
					elif 'Total Coronavirus Deaths' in title:
						v['death'] = process_array(sector)
					elif 'Total Coronavirus Currently Infected' in title:
						v['active'] = process_array(sector)
					else:
						continue
	return v
	

def download_virus_at(countries):
	r = {}
	for country in countries:
		url = 'https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/%s'%(country)
		response = requests.get(url)
		page = response.text
		soup = BeautifulSoup(page,"html5lib")
		r[country] = get_text_bs(soup)
		
	with open( 'virus_world.json', 'w') as f:
		json.dump(r, f)
	
"""add to COUNTRY if you want to include more,
   find country code on the worldmeters website
"""

COUNTRY = ['us','china','italy']

While coronavirus in China seems to be under control, here in US, it is just starting to go wild. The number of confirmed cases in US on March 31st is about 188,530 and some officials predict up to [240,000 death](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths)

Figure 1 (a). Total confirmed cases in US, China, Italy   (b). Log scale. Slope is obtained by breaking the data into smaller sections, and taking the maximum slope. Slope is calculated every 14 days using linear regression. 

Figure 1 shows three countries at three phases of coronavirus. In China, the number of cases reached an almost stationary state at day 30 and seems to be under control. In Italy, the rate has slowed down and hopefully it will look like the green line soon. In US, we are still at the blooming stage, but there is a slow-down sign at the tip of the blue line. We have a little hope it seems... In the log scale graph, US and China has a higher infection rate, which makes sense as US and China is more densely populated.



#### Analysis

My first intuition of the graph 1(a) US (blue line) is that the data probably follows an exponential trend ain the early stage, as shown in the log graph 1(b). The green curve looks more a sigmoid function. So let's start with a simple exponential model. Define **I** as infection population and assuming each patient passes on to **A** number of new people everyday. It can be tested by by plotting log(y) against t figure 1(b):  

$
\begin{equation} \label{0}
I = I_{0}\times A^{t}
\end{equation}
$

where t is number of days since $I_{0}$ cases. 

This model only fits the blue line, not so much for the yellow and green line. After doing some research on spread of infectious diseases, it seems an SIR-model might work. The model consists of three parts: infected population, susceptible population and recovered/immune population. As I am trying to model the total confirmed cases, not the active, I can drop the recovery part for simplicity. Then the math becomes simpler and boils down to solving an ordinary differential equation. To simplify, let's define population as 1 and **I(t)** is the percentage of population that is infected and **S(t)** is the proportion of susceptible population.  If we divide both side by $\delta t$, we can get $\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{dS}{dt}=0$. 

$\begin{equation} \label{1}
S(t)+I(t) = 1
\end{equation}$


Define $\beta$  as  transmission rate. Upon further reflection, the rate of infection should be affected by both infection and susceptible population.  To consider two extreme cases, 
- when s = 1 , i = 0, the transmission rate, $\beta$ = 0
- when s = 0 , i = 1, everyone is infected and no more new cases, $\beta$ = 0 

$\begin{equation} \label{2}
\frac{dI}{dt} = - \frac{dS}{dt} = \beta S I
\end{equation}$

This is equation is an ODE function, and we can solve it using scipy package. 

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests
from helper import ODE_model

js = pd.read_json('virus_world.json')

def SI_model(c):
    v = np.array(js[c]['total'])
    v = v/(np.max(v)) # standardized
    y0 = v[0]

    t = np.linspace(0,50)

    # solve ODEs
    k1,k2,k3 = 0.1,0.3,0.5
    y1 = odeint(ODE_model,y0,t,args=(k1,))
    y2 = odeint(ODE_model,y0,t,args=(k2,))
    y3 = odeint(ODE_model,y0,t,args=(k3,))

    # plot results
    plt.plot(t,y1,'y:',linewidth=2,label='β=0.1')
    plt.plot(t,y2,'b:',linewidth=2,label='β=0.3')
    plt.plot(t,y3,'g:',linewidth=2,label='β=0.5')
    d = min(len(t),len(v))
    plt.plot(t[:d],v[:d],'r',linewidth=2,label=c)
    
    plt.xlabel('t')
    plt.ylabel('I(t)')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('SI model fitting ')

    plt.show()
    
SI_model(c='china')


```

In fact, turns out function $\begin{equation} \label{}
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I \cdot (1-I)
\end{equation}$  is the derivate of sigmoid function $\begin{equation} \label{}
I = \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}
\end{equation}$



#### Prediction using sigmoid function

```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
import json
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import requests
import time
 
def logistic_function(t, K, P0, r):
    'define logsitc function here, try yourself'
    return 
  
def prediction(c):
    predict_days = 30
    data = pd.read_json('data/virus_world.json')[c]
    confirm = np.array(data['total'])
    scaler = np.max(confirm)
    confirm = confirm/(scaler)
    
    x = np.arange(len(confirm))
    # curve fit
    popt, pcov = curve_fit(logistic_function, x, confirm,maxfev=2000)
    #predit future
    predict_x = list(x) + [x[-1] + i for i in range(1, 1 + predict_days)]
    predict_x = np.array(predict_x)
    predict_y = logistic_function(predict_x, popt[0], popt[1], popt[2])
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.plot(x, confirm, '^',label="confimed infected number")
    plt.plot(predict_x, predict_y, '--',label="predicted infected number")
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)
    plt.yticks(rotation=90)

    plt.suptitle("Coronavirus cases prediction in %s for the next %d days (Pred = %d,  r=%.2f)"%(c.capitalize(),predict_days,scaler*predict_y[-1], popt[2]), fontsize=12, fontweight="bold")
    plt.title("Predict time:{}".format(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d", time.localtime())), fontsize=16)
    plt.xlabel('days', fontsize=14)
    plt.ylabel('Infected number', fontsize=14)
    plt.show()
    
prediction(c='china')
```
