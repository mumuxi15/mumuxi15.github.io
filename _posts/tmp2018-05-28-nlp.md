1. Topic Modelling 

- - Feature_extraction using TF-IDF
  - Decomposition techniques using NMF





NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, it is defined as the computational technique to understand and manipulate human language and speech. Here we are going to demostrate how we can extract topics from anime descriptions with help of NLP.

Two challenges of this project. 

1. words have different forms 

1. A lot of anime terms appeared frequently. 

Solutions to solve NLP challenges:

- Preprocess words with stemming and lemmatizing techinque to reduce different forms of a word. For example, beautiful -> beauty, cars -> car
- TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)
