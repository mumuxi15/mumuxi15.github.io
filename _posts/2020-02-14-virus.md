Intro: Coronavirus





This is a on going project, not completed yet.



I was trying to find an updated case number for corona virus in China.  When you search on google, there are billions of articles and news in your search results. Yet, could not find a single number for 20 minutes. Information is either irrelevant, out of date or hidden deeply behind charts. Then I decide to scrape the charts and write a few scripts to answer my questions: How is corona virus going ? Is it getting better ? Are things in control ?  



The data is scraped from Buzzfeed and they claimed they collect data from WHO. It was slightly tricky to get the link to the dataset as they do not make life easier. The link was embeded inside iframe structures and I will post it direcly here [source](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dmZGM/12/). 



I will update this post later once I start the data analysis part. 



Project in posted in my [GitHub](https://github.com/mumuxi15/coronavirus). Thanks for reading !
